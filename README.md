# Instruction-Set-Interpreter-for-Basic-Computer

**Part 1: Reading from a Text File**

	1- Create a text file containing instructions in either binary or HEX format. Each line should represent a single instruction.
 
	2- Write a program that reads the instructions from the text file.
 
	3- Implement a parser to interpret the instructions and execute them accordingly.
 
	4- Display the output or result of each instruction to the screen.

**Part 2: Reading from the Screen (Binary or HEX) BOTH ARE MANDATORY**

	1- Prompt the user to input instructions directly from the screen in either binary or HEX format.
 
	2- Implement a parser to interpret the user input and execute the instructions.
 
	3- Display the output or result of each instruction to the screen.

**Part 3: Reading from the Screen (Instruction String)**

	1- Prompt the user to input instructions as a string directly from the screen.
 
	2- Implement a parser to interpret the instruction string and execute the instructions.
 
	3- Display the output or result of each instruction to the screen.
